# Tempest Watch

Tempest watch is a web app that allows players to report what tempest is active in each end game map for Path of Exile.
When players enter a map and discover which tempest is active, they can report that tempest so that other players know which tempests are active in each map.
This will help you know which end game maps are currently rewarding, and which are dangerous.
You can also use this tool to help complete the challenges involving tempests!

## Features
- Lists each map with it's currently active tempest
- Lets you report tempests you encounter so other players can know

### Potential Features
- Logging of most common/least common tempests so we can determine how likely each tempest is
- AutoHotkey macro that fetches the tempest for the map under your cursor and displays it in a tooltip
- In game bot that you can report tempests to

## Contribution
Contributions to this project are always welcome. If you have a great idea that will improve Tempest Tracker please submit a pull request.
Collaborations are great too, if you are thinking of making a tool that interacts with Tempest Tracker (e.g. an AutoHotkey macro), and need a new API or feature open an issue and I'll get it added.

## API
Version 0 of the API is final. It will not be changed. Version 1 of the API may change until it is marked final.

### V1
V1 is identical to V0 except for the `current_tempest` routes. For the `current_tempest` routes the numbers of votes and type of tempests are added. Furthermore, instead of having the full description of the tempest, `base` and `suffix` are the names of the base and suffix. You can look up what they mean using the `/tempests` api call.

#### Current Tempests
Type is one of 'great', 'dangerous', or ''
